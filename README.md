My code is in connectfour.py
Note that the same strategy as in tictactoe is used. However, there a HUGE number of variations for connect4, so it it harder to train the bot. I ran it a bunch of times with an increasing number of training games. The most I had patience for was 100k, which took a while (several minutes), which resulted in a about 40 percent win rate against a bot that simply makes winning moves if it can, and blocks winning moves if it can. That's still not pretty high, but a lot better than <1 percent, which is what you get without training. I"m sure if you increased it to a million training games, it would then win most against the opponent bot.
