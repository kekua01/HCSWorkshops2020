# HCSWorkshops2020

Four little mini projects for this workshop:

1. wbw.py prints out the most popular posts from Wait But Why, an internet blog, and arranges them in descending order of number of comments.

2. weather.py pulls data from the government weather site (this was basically the tutorial found here: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/)

3. yoda_quotes.py prints out a bunch of yoda quotes from a random site, formatted nicely

4. The flask api folder is a mini Flask API project I started (it doesn't do much).
